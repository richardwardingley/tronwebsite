    <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
    <p>
        There are many copyright issues and other constraints affecting websites. For most beginner websites the issues are normally with copyright to pictures. When choosing images, to avoid copyright people would need to use free picture sites, a paid stock media site, or credit the image source directly. This is the same with music and people would need to buy the licencing rights to it.<br>
        Using a stock media site could give Royalty Free (RF) which is a simple licence meaning they only have to pay once to use that media without having to renew a licence fee [1]. If using an image online it is always best to assume it is copyrighted until you can prove it isn’t. <br>
        To prevent infringing copyright of Intellectual Property, which is the work or creativity of others, such as a design, then the original source must be attributed, thereby acknowledging the author [2].<br>
        If using, or distributing, particular software on a website then that site needs the appropriate licencing rights to use or distribute it.
        <br> The use of copyrighted material could incur heavy fines.<br>
        For my project I have used general images and GIFs found through Google. If making a real website, then these could not be used but for the purpose of this project they can be.

    <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account </h3>
    <p>
        There are many conditions that could make a website less accessible to someone, including visual impairment, hearing impairment, motor skills/physical disabilities, photosensitive seizures, and cognitive disabilities.<br>
        Assistive technologies can be used to help improve their online experiences, such as screen readers to convert page text to speech, assisting visually impairment people. Speech recognition software, which converts speech to text means they can input back into the computer. Braille terminals mean they can use touch to read page text. Having resizable text that doesn’t break the website, means people can enlarge text and make it more readable for them [3]. <br>
        Some people can’t use a mouse so websites need to be keyboard friendly, thereby working by navigating the site only using the keyboard. This will help people with special needs or motor skills disabilities that must use alternative keyboards.<br>
        Adding alternative text to images helps give information about the picture if it fails to load.<br>
        The design scheme can be important as well. Choosing the correct colour font on the correct colour background can help colour-blind and dyslexic people read the text easier.
