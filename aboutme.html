<h1 class="pageTitle">About Me</h1>
<br>
<p class="blackBox">
    I’m Richard and I come from’t Yorkshire. That there Yorkshire up there *points*.
    <br>
    I moved to Manchester at the start or 2020 for a fresh start, until the outbreak happened and we all got stuck inside. Luckily, my current course with Code Nation has kept me occupied!
    <br>
    <br>
    Now it's time for a new venture into website design!

    <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
    <p>
    Since moving to Manchester, and before the lockdown, I started many hobbies:
</p>
<p>
    Choir – I go to a 4 part acapella community choir, singing in the tenor section. They have started doing the session online during lockdown. Only the MD has their mic on, otherwise it would be hectic!
</p>
<p>
    Gymnastics – I did gymnastics when younger doing tumbling. I now go to adult classes just for fun, at Manchester Academy of Gymnastics.
</p>
<p>
    Salsa – I started up a salsa class as I had never tried salsa before. I enjoy it but I think I prefer Latin and Ballroom, which I have done before at a basic level.
</p>
<p>
    Musical theatre – I started going to a musical theatre class, doing singing and dancing in the ensemble for Saturday Night Fever with South Manchester Amateur Operatic Society (SMAOS). I’d never done anything like this before and it is way out of my comfort zone, but I thought I’d give it a try. The show is currently postponed until further notice.
</p>
<p>
    Ice skating – I go ice skating just for fun at Planet Ice in Altringham. I have previously done adult figure skating lessons when I lived in Sheffield. I’m much more of a jumper than a spinner!
</p>
<p>
    Roller derby – This sport could be described as a cross between rugby and British bulldogs on roller skates. Since January I have been going to Manchester Roller Derby beginner sessions that teach complete newbies. I’ve taken to the skating quickly because of my previous ice-skating experience.

    <h3>Education:</h3>
    <p>
    BSc Biochemistry from the University of Leeds
    <br>
    MSc Bionanotechnology from the University of Sheffield – I got my name include on a scientific paper! Read it <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4785676/pdf/emss-67471.pdf" target="blank">here!</a>
    <br>
    Level 2 Software development with Code Nation – currently completing

    <h3>Experience with Code Nation:</h3>
    <p>
    I have been into the Code Nation Manchester office many times. I went to a ‘Code Along’ which gave me an introduction to HTML and CSS, making the foundation of a basic website. I then went to an iOS Swift development evening, in which we made a basic dice game that would run on Apple devices.
    <br>
    I wanted to learn more, so I booked onto their 3-week Developer course. I am currently making this website as part of the website development project. This is something I am greatly enjoying, and I am wanting to go onto a level 4 apprenticeship to begin a career in tech and increase my skill set.
