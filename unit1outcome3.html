    <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency </h3>
<p>
    When completing a previous project (making a text-based game in Javascript), as a team, we all had access to the Trello board and it could get disorganised. People labelled things in different ways and moved tasks before they were completed. There was a lot of going back and forth, or none at all, when people were expecting others to complete it. Also, when using online flowchart software <a href="https://diagrams.net" target="blank">(diagrams.net)</a>, someone would change something and then someone else would change it back. Things kept going around in circles and productivity and efficiency dropped dramatically. Once people were working on their own sections then momentum picked back up.
    <br>
    <br>
    Using Trello as an individual is really useful to keep organised, thereby increasing productivity and efficiency. VS Code was efficient for coding the site as it is intuitive to use.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have a laptop with a good specification, meaning it doesn’t freeze and I can get on with work. I have up to date versions of VS Code and internet browsers. All the fully functioning hardware and software increase productivity and efficiency from not having to sort non-project related issues. However, it is easy to get confused by having too many programmes open at once. From doing the project I currently have 11 windows open, with 25 tabs in total from 2 browser windows. When searching for the correct one between window, it takes time and reduces my productivity. For future projects I will only open essential windows and close ones I have finished with.

    <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
    <p>
        To keep energy levels up then a healthy balanced diet should be eaten, and avoiding high-sugar content. This should stop lethargic feelings from sugar highs and lows.
        <br>
        <br>
        Regular breaks should be taken to give your eyes a rest from the computer screen and keep concentration. No background distractions is also advisable, however, some people prefer to work with music so it’s whatever works best for you.
        <br>
        <br>
        Tasks should be planned and broken down into manageable sections. Using project planning software like Trello, means task progression can be monitored to make sure everything is on track. This can be used to decide realistic goals to be completed in a set time frame. If these get completed, you can say it has been productive. If you complete them all a head of schedule then you are being efficient as well.
        <br>
        <br>
        All tools available should be used, eg. teachers, other students, google. This saves time by increasing productivity by keeping things efficient, by not spending a lot of time on things that could easily be done quickly by using a different method.

    <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
    <p>
        If the project were to be done again but in a team, we could all use the knowledge and expertise of our teammates. This could save time, streamlining the processes and being more efficient, thereby increasing productivity. However, there would also be disagreements on what course of action to take, for example, the design theme. This could make the planning stage longer, slowing down the momentum of the project. Once everyone agreed then the project should speed up, however people may have different expectations. As we have done the project individually already, it would be interesting to try it as a team and compare the experiences. The most important thing would to keep effective communication.
        <br>
        <br>
        Even though not in a team at the moment for website project, everyone is still able to ask the other people on the course for help, for instance over Slack and Zoom. The ability to share screen and ask for help pointing out errors in code has increased productivity as people don’t get bogged down trying to find solutions on their own. We are working on separate projects but can still perform teamwork.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’ve found that using the Trello board to break aims down into much smaller tasks makes the whole thing less daunting. This helps you to get started quicker and productivity rises. If there was a programme similar to Trello but also could be arranged as a flow-diagram, to show the linear progression of different routes of the project, then I think that would also help my own productivity.

    <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
    <p>
        Testing software should be done by verifying that the software correctly carries out the required function. Then it needs to be made sure it is meeting the requirements of the project. These two steps can be done by manually, following test scenarios, or automatically by executing a script. Black box testing is where the tester is testing it from the software interface without looking at code. White box testing is making sure the interface is working as should be expected from what the code says [1].
        <br>
        <br>
        I tested as and when I made changes, by saving in VS Code and viewing the change in the browser to make sure it did what I wanted it to do. I felt there was no point trying to complete it all and only test after doing a lot of work and then realise you don’t know which part is has the error.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another way to test would be to have other people review it. This could be done through sites such as GitHub, where you can show them and let them tell you what they think is good or bad. You can tell them what you’ve done, ask them questions how to improve it, get feedback off experts, ask how to improve things technically, and get ideas for future ideas.
        <br>
        <br>
        If completing a real life project I would also test on multiple screen sizes and devices (depending what the software was) to make sure it works on all. I would also test on multiple platforms, eg. Windows, Apple, Android.
