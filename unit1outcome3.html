    <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency </h3>
<p>
    Think of JS game – pros and cons
    Not personal projects if in a team
    Planning stage take longer as more input from more people
    If did website as a team pro cons would be xyz. Can’t take credit for everything. Flow between pages could be bad
    
    
    If did website on own pros cons would be xyz – shows what you’ve done, personal recognition and satisfaction
    
    Vs code efficient for doing the site. Got laptop, vs code, browser, up to date, good hardware
    
</p>

    <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
    <p>
        Healthy balanced diet, so not feeling lethargic from sugar highs and lows
        Regular breaks to give eyes a rest from screen and keep concentration
        Energy levels
        No background distractions
        Plan and break tasks down into manageable sections and keep a track of what has been done to keep on track
        
        Building the website is efficient as got everything you need, eg laptop, software
        
        If face to face instead of virtual
        
        Set realistic goals and tasks to complete in a time frame and if complete them then can say productive
        
        Definition of productivity and efficiency
        
        Utilise all tools available, eg. teachers, other students, google. Saves time, increases productivity by keeping things efficient by not spending a lot of time on things that could easily be done quickly by using a different method.

    <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
    <p>
        Say what you would do if had more time
        If in a team, use knowledge of your teammates and their expertise.
        Some think the more the better
        Some think simple, less is more, sleek
        Some could manage the team if they have all rounder skills
        A lot of professional sites have easy to navigate sites
        
        If good at back end then improve CSS
        If good at front end then improve back end
        
        Communication if in a team
        Even though not in a team at the mo for website, can still ask the other people on the course for help, like over slack, zoom, share screen, error on line 73 etc, still teamwork but on separate projects
        How using things that are beneficial

    <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
    <p>
        Test as and when make changes. No point trying to complete it all and only test at the end or doing a lot of work and then realise you don’t know which part it is.
        Used VS code for this project and then tested it using a browser
        
        Have people review it, like on github, show them, let them tell you what they think is good or bad, tell them what you’ve done, ask them questions how to improve it, get feedback off experts, ask how to improve things technically, design, coding, for future things, get ideas
        If they’re asking you back, can give each other ideas
        Test on multiple screen sizes and devices (depending what the software was) to make sure it works on all
        Test on multiple platforms, eg. windows, apple, android
