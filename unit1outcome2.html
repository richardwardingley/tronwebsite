    <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h3>
<p>
    Throughout the website development project, I was happy with the IT tools used. To begin with I only had my laptop screen which meant I had to keep switching between windows. This was especially problematic now that the course was virtual, as it was difficult not being able to see Zoom all the time. Due to this issue, a separate monitor was sourced, which meant I could view Zoom and do notes at the same time. My laptop had no issues running the software whilst having multiple other windows open at the same time. A different code editing programme, such as <a href="https://www.codepen.io" target="blank">codepen</a>, could have been used, however I felt comfortable using VS Code. We had previously been introduced to Javascript on VS Code and saw how the programme operated, so there was already a familiarity with it. We had also used Trello before, using the Kanban Method, to plan making a Javascript text game and this worked well. Because we had used both software packages before with successful outcomes, I didn’t feel that the IT tools or approach needed to be changed when planning and making the website.

    <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h3>
    <p>
        The IT tools selected and used were appropriate for the project. Trello was used to plan the project by breaking down main aims into individual task cards. This helped to keep organised, prioritise tasks, and keep track of what had been done and what still needed doing. New task cards, or edits to other task cards, could be added easily making the Trello board a useful and productive use of time. VS Code gave me a platform to write HTML and CSS scripts with no problems. It was set out well with good functionality, making it easy to use and good for learning on. Google Chrome opened and displayed my website with no issues. All the IT tools used performed their intended tasks well with no issues, helping me to achieve the project outcomes.

    <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
    <p>
        I think for the level I’m at, having to learn to use the tools, how to code, and coding the actual website, all in the short timescale given, my website didn’t come out too bad. It had a central theme running throughout, meshed well through the design aspects of colour, background pictures, layout, and fonts. I manage to accomplish some of the more technical tasks I had planned to do, like make a hover drop down menu bar, with themed formatting. I think this works really well on my website.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am not entirely happy with my final website though. I had big ideas of what I wanted to do but I never managed to do some of them. Maybe they were just delusions of grandeur for the level I am currently at. I think given more time, and some deeper understanding, I would have been able achieve greater things. However, it has given me motivation to learn more in my own time and do my own projects. I will see if I can accomplish the plans I initially set out to do. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I do feel some areas of the website are a little basic. I have a lot of text boxes which I initially wanted to make more interactive, such as expand when hovered over. Unfortunately, I ran out of time and had to leave them as they are. However, I still kept them within the design theme and used the opacity setting so some of the background picture could still be seen through. I decided not to put other pictures with the text as they would break up the style theme of the site.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have learnt a lot whilst doing this project. I have gone from zero knowledge to building a website in a short space of time, thereby achieving the project goal. I am going to use this learning experience to tackle more complicated projects, such as using Javascript to make the website interactive, and put it onto GitHub for potential employers to see.

    <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
    <p>
        I think if doing the website again I would look for better quality and higher resolution gifs and images, so they’re not as pixelated when enlarged. Also, a button to take the user back to the top of the page from the bottom so they don’t need to scroll. Next time, I would not use an unordered list (ul) to make the drop down menu, as the way I have formatted it in CSS stops me using another ul.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would make the text more exciting to view, using pictures to break it up so it’s not just blocks. I would code different ways for the text to be viewed, such as pop up boxes or an expanding view when hovered over.
        <br>
        <br>
        I think the website could have been more interactive so the user can have a more immersive experience. This could be achieved by adding some Javascript.
        <br>
        <br>
        Also, I would make more notes in the code, as I feel this is best practice. This wouldn’t just help me understand my code but for others looking at my code, so they knew what I had done and why.
        <br>
        <br>
        Many of these things I am going to try in my own time when trying new projects.

    <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
    <p>
        From the project brief, requirement outcomes have been met. The site has a consistent style throughout, focusing on a Tron theme. The drop down on hover menu bar provides clear and easy to use navigation from any page to any page. I used development techniques of ID and class for specific formatting across different HTML pages linked from CSS. The completed tasks on Trello were tested and work well. For any Trello tasks that were not completed, these were moved to the ‘To do if had more time’ list. This list is for the tasks that either could have been completed with a bit more time, or tasks that needed further learning to achieve. Overall, the website pages are error free and fit for purpose.
