    <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
<p>
    There are many roles that IT serves in modern business. The normal reason for introducing new technology is to make tasks easier. An example of this would be using mail merge to print out many different names and addresses on letters, changing these details en masse digitally and not by hand. However, email can be used instead of sending out traditional letters through the post, thereby saving paper and trees, and being more environmentally friendly. You can also cut down your carbon footprint by video calling instead of having to travel to different countries for meetings. Thanks to email and video calling, communication has been made easier, quicker, and more efficient. These can be used between a business and clients and saves time having to meet face-to-face. Some businesses also employ using more casual instant messaging platforms (such as Skype for business) for internal communication between colleagues. Different digital communication methods make more things possible that otherwise wouldn’t have been. For example, for this website development project, we have been using Slack, Zoom, and Google Hangouts to communicate through instead of an in-person classroom learning experience, due to the international pandemic. Not only can people save time when communicating through IT, but also when sorting through and storing data. IT can help comply with GDPR laws as files can much easier be searched through and retrieved [1]. This improves efficiency and productivity of working. IT systems also save space as there is no longer the need for big storage rooms storing boxes and boxes of paper files. As these are no longer needed then it is much easier to keep track of files. This improves organisation, and planning tasks along with it. All of this saves on manpower and overheads, which in turn reduces costs. Costs are reduced for some retailers that don’t need physical retail locations anymore as people can buy online. This also improves accessibility for people who cannot leave their homes as often.

    <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
    <p>
        To complete a digital project successfully a team needs good communication skills. They need to be able to communicate with colleagues effectively so understand each other’s roles, what they are and aren’t doing, to not repeat work or miss it out completely. They need to be able to plan and organise their tasks, and this could be using tools such as a Trello board to see what needs doing and assign tasks [2]. Job cards can be created, using the Kanban Method of ‘To-do’, ‘Doing’, and ‘Done’ [3]. The board can use different colours for different task and be used to keep track of who is doing what. People would need the technical skills to be able to use the software in the first place. In the example of making a website, the person would have to know how to code and input it into VS Code. They would also need research skills to find solutions when posed with something difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
        The tools required will be software that fits the need of the project. For example, if a website was being created then VS Code could be used to make HTML and CSS pages, which are used linked together. A browser would also be required to test the code and make sure the HTML and CSS are communicating with each other correctly. They would also need the correct hardware for the software to run on.

    <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h3>
    <p>
        There are many ways to plan tasks using different IT packages. Trello can be used by taking the overall aim of the project and breaking it down into building blocks and specific tasks. As the project progresses, new tasks can be added. The tasks can be added into different columns, such as the priority of the task, the type of task, or who is going to complete the task. Colour coding can also be used as well. When a task that needs to be done is thought of, it can be added to the ‘To do’ list. When the task is in process it can be placed into the ‘Doing’ list, and into the ‘Done’ list when completed. Using the Trello board helps to monitor what has been done and what’s left to do. It can be used in a team as people can add tasks and edit and move other people’s tasks.
        <br>
Trello was used for my website development project, and the board can be seen here: https://trello.com/b/Prpv0Xk9/website-development-project-cn-assignment-2-richard-wardingley

    <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
    <p>
        Digital projects could fail for many reasons. If they are using unsuitable hardware, such as older computers, then it might not support the software being used. Also, the software being used could be inappropriate for the task it was being used for. Both the correct hardware and software need to be chosen. Also, people need to know how to use the software, otherwise they won’t get the full benefit, and productivity and efficiency could fall. Any work needs to be saved and backed up to a safe place, to prevent loss of data, from unexpected things such as power cuts or fire.
        </p>
        <p>
        The computers need to be on a stable, secure network. Nowadays, with everything becoming digital, there are many breaches in cyber security, such as the current concern of the virtual meeting programme, ‘Zoom’, not being secure [4]. Protection needs to be in place from hackers, viruses and malware, and this will need constantly updating to protect against the latest threats. Consultant cyber security experts can be hired to monitor your network and computers, but they don’t come cheap!

    <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
    <p>
        The chosen computers need the minimum requirements suitable for the software you will be running. This means having a processor powerful enough to run the programme. The computers also need a suitable amount of RAM (Random Access Memory). If the processor isn’t powerful enough or there isn’t enough available RAM then the software could run slowly, or not at all. There also needs to be enough storage space on the computer for the software, any files saved, and room for any updates it may need. You would also have to think about how many people would need their own computer terminal and how many units to purchase, along with peripherals.
        </p>
        <p>
        The hardware could depend on people’s operating system preference, such as Windows or Mac. The software chosen needs to be suitable for the job. You don’t want a programme that only does half of what you need if there are other suitable alternatives. Research needs to be done on what is appropriate and available. The cost of the software must be factored in. It may be possible to find a free version that can be downloaded. Also, you many need to purchase software licences for the number of computers or people that will be using it [5].
        <p>
        In the long term, although it may have a higher initial outlay cost, it is advisable to ‘future proof’ the hardware and software. This means that the system as a whole can be used for longer as it will not be outdated too soon. The extra cost of future proofing will be offset by the savings made from not having to update your systems too often.

    <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h3>
    <p>
        The class used Zoom to conference call and do virtual learning. I planned out my tasks on Trello, using the Kanban Method of ‘To do’, ‘Doing’, and ‘Done’. I also put in a list of ‘To do Urgently’, to prioritise tasks. I colour coded these into different categories, eg. coding, research, design. These different list and categories helped me plan the order of tasks and aided in the completion of them by keeping me organised by visually representing what I had completed and what was left to do. The ability to move tasks around made it easy to keep track, as the progress of the project could be seen at a quick glance. Also, the job cards could be quickly edited if the tasks had changed slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
        I used Visual Studio Code, which gave me a platform to programme my website using HTML and CSS. A browser (I’m using Google Chrome) meant I could then view and test my code. The browser was also used to do online research for project questions and coding troubleshooting. Both these software choices were suitable as they performed their intended task with no issues, and I felt comfortable using both. My laptop has suitable processing power and memory to run VS Code and Chrome. GitHub has helped me as a platform to submit my website development project and also to showcase my work to any prospective employers.
        </p>
        <p>
        All of these used together meant I was able to plan, research, design, code, create, and submit my website project successfully.
